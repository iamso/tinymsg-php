    "tinymsg/msg": "*"

## Usage

### Include

```php
// With Composer
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Without Composer
require 'path/to/tinymsg/msg.php';
```

### Create instance

```php
// Importing the namespace
use tinymsg\Msg;

// Server without SSL
$msg = new Msg('channel-name', 'tinymsg.domain.tld');

// Server with SSL
$msg = new Msg('channel-name', 'tinymsg.domain.tld', true);

// Localhost with special port
$msg = new Msg('channel-name', 'localhost:7777', false, 7777);

// Using the fully qualified namespace name
$msg = new tinymsg/Msg(...);
```
### Send a message

```php
// Send a message
$msg->send('string');
$msg->send(array(1,2,3,4));
$msg->send(array('key' => 'value'));
```

### Open/close socket

When you create an Msg instance, the constructor opens the socket connection.
You can close and reopen the connection, if needed.

```php
// Close the socket connection
$msg->close();

// (Re-) Open the socket connection
$msg->open();

```
